# FlexStorage Test Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Testing Framework:** xUnit, FluentAssertions
**Approach:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Red, Green, Refactor
**Architecture:** Domain-Driven Design (DDD) - Inside-Out Testing

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Order Rationale
1. **Domain Layer First** (No dependencies, pure business logic)
2. **Application Layer** (Depends on Domain)
3. **Infrastructure Layer** (Depends on Domain & Application interfaces)
4. **API Layer** (Depends on all layers)
5. **Integration Tests** (End-to-end flows)

**Note:** This test plan is organized by **DDD layers** (inside-out testing), which differs from the **feature phases (P0-P4)** in BACKEND_SPEC.md. For example:
- **Feature Phase P0 (MVP)** in BACKEND_SPEC includes: Simple upload, S3 Glacier Deep + Flexible providers, API Key auth, file retrieval, plugin interface
- Tests for these MVP features span multiple test groups here: Domain (Groups 1-3), Application (Group 5), Infrastructure (Groups 8-9), API (Group 11)

Follow this test plan's order for TDD implementation - it ensures solid foundations (Domain) before building on top (Infrastructure, API).

### TDD Cycle
```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
Write failing test → Make it pass → Improve code
```

- **Impact:** Need additional test cases for retrieval workflow and status tracking

### Next Steps
- **PRIORITY:** Refactor download/retrieval API design (Group 11.4.1)
  - Split mixed concerns into separate endpoints
  - Add comprehensive retrieval workflow tests
  - Implement retrieval status tracking
- Group 8: Infrastructure Layer (S3 Glacier providers, EF Core repositories)
- Group 11.1: AuthController (API Key authentication)
- Group 11.2: FilesController (Upload functionality)
- Group 6: Rate Limiting & Quota services

**Test Class:** `FilesControllerTests.cs` (8 tests passing - download functionality complete)
**Dependencies:** FileRetrievalService, ThumbnailGenerationService
**Location:** `backend/tests/FlexStorage.API.Tests/FilesControllerTests.cs:14`

**Recent Implementation Details:**
- ✅ Added `DownloadFile` endpoint at `GET /api/v1/Files/{id}/download`
- ✅ Added `GetUserFilesAsync` method to `IFileRetrievalService` and implementation
- ✅ Updated `FileRetrievalService` to support user file listing with pagination
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage including:
  - Successful file download with proper headers
  - 404 handling for missing files
  - 400 handling for download failures
  - 500 handling for null file streams
  - User file listing functionality
- ✅ All 8 tests passing in `FilesControllerTests.cs`
- ✅ All 31 tests passing in Application layer
- ✅ Download endpoint ready for integration testing

**🚨 ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:**
The current `/download` endpoint handles TWO distinct operations:
1. **Direct Download** (200 OK + file stream) - for immediately available files
2. **Retrieval Initiation** (202 Accepted + restoration info) - for archived files

**Recommendation:** Split into separate endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/Files/{id}/download` - Direct download only (fail if archived)
- `POST /api/v1/Files/{id}/retrieve` - Initiate retrieval for archived files
- `GET /api/v1/Files/{id}/retrieve/{retrievalId}` - Check retrieval status

**Additional Test Cases Needed:**
- ✅ Should return 202 when file needs restoration (currently implemented)
- ⬜ Should return 409 if retrieval already in progress
- ⬜ Should return retrieval status by retrieval ID
- ⬜ Should allow download after successful retrieval
- ⬜ Should handle retrieval timeout/failure
- ⬜ Should validate retrieval tier selection
- ⬜ Should track retrieval costs and quotas

---

### 11.4.1 FilesController (Retrieval Workflow) ⬜
**Status:** Architecture needs refactoring - current implementation mixes concerns

**Recommended API Design:**

POST /api/v1/Files/{id}/retrieve          # Initiate retrieval (archived files)
GET  /api/v1/Files/{id}/retrieve/{rid}    # Check retrieval status
```

**Test Cases for Separate Retrieval API:**
- ⬜ Should initiate retrieval with tier selection (bulk/standard/expedited)
- ⬜ Should return retrieval ID and estimated completion time
- ⬜ Should return 409 if retrieval already in progress for same file
- ⬜ Should return 400 if file is not archived (doesn't need retrieval)
- ⬜ Should validate retrieval tier is supported by provider
- ⬜ Should track retrieval costs against user quota
- ⬜ Should return retrieval status (pending/in_progress/completed/failed)
- ⬜ Should return progress percentage if available
- ⬜ Should return download URL when retrieval completed
- ⬜ Should expire retrieval request after timeout (24-48 hours)
- ⬜ Should send webhook notification when retrieval ready
